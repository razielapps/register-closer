## 🛠️ **How It Works**
The tool calculates the **average attendance percentage** using the following formula:  

1️⃣ **Multiply**:  
   - `Total attendance for the week` × `Total students in class` → **full_total**  
   - `Total school open days` × `Total students in class` → **open_total**  

2️⃣ **Calculate**:  
   - `full_total` × **100** → **tastw**  
   - `open_total` × `total students in class` → **tsots**  

3️⃣ **Get the final percentage**:  
   - `tastw ÷ tsots` → **Average Attendance %**  

📌 **The final result is rounded to 1 decimal place**
